Ideas on how to implement feedback (making game less repetitive)

-make ingredients spawn at random areas of the kitchen
	-set the random positions in code and choose random / set a specific position for every level

-make the player do obstacles to get to the ingredients after level 1
	-would have to pause time/increase time

//////////////Planning

Maybes
-add the new ingredients in during tutorial 
-add the new ingredients in after level one
	-add an obstacle to obtain new ingredient
		-add 3d objects for the obstacles
		-make a pop up to notify player (pause time or increase all game time for each level)
			make image and add text 
		-a door leading to the obstacle
		-make a new scene and teleport player to the scene after they collide with the door / make it a part of the same scene but teleport player to the same location inside kitchen
		-a particle around the ingredient
