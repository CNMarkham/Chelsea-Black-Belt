Ideas on how to implement feedback (making game less repetitive)

-make ingredients spawn at random areas of the kitchen
	-set the random positions in code and choose random / set a specific position for every level

-make the player do obstacles to get to the ingredients after level 1
	-would have to pause time/increase time

//////////////Planning

Maybes
-add the new ingredients in during tutorial 
-add the new ingredients in after level one
	-add an obstacle to obtain new ingredient
		-add 3d objects for the obstacles
		-make a pop up to notify player (pause time or increase all game time for each level)
			make image and add text 
		-a door leading to the obstacle
		-make a new scene and teleport player to the scene after they collide with the door / make it a part of the same scene but teleport player to the same location inside kitchen
		-a particle around the ingredient 
		

Final Plan
1. tutorial - learn how to make the sushi roll
2. level 1 - sushi roll
3. level 2 - introduce new recipe + make tuna nigiri
4. level 3 - option 1 (make both sushi roll and tuna nigiri) OR option 2 ( make tuna nigiri)
5. level 4 - option 1 (make multiple sushi roll/tuna nigiri) OR option 2 (make both sushi roll and tuna nigiri)

how to introduce the tuna nigiri
-text will pop up on screen
	-check if level counter is 2 (if so, make text show up to navigate player to the new ingredient)
	-make the stand with new ingredient active



levels after introducing new recipe
-reset the tuna ingredient back to where it was 

if the text doesn't work
-make cutscenes :(
