Ideas on how to implement feedback (making game less repetitive)

-make ingredients spawn at random areas of the kitchen
	-set the random positions in code and choose random / set a specific position for every level

-make the player do obstacles to get to the ingredients after level 1
	-would have to pause time/increase time

//////////////Planning

Maybes
-add the new ingredients in during tutorial 
-add the new ingredients in after level one
	-add an obstacle to obtain new ingredient
		-add 3d objects for the obstacles
		-make a pop up to notify player (pause time or increase all game time for each level)
			make image and add text 
		-a door leading to the obstacle
		-make a new scene and teleport player to the scene after they collide with the door / make it a part of the same scene but teleport player to the same location inside kitchen
		-a particle around the ingredient 


final plan
-tutorial (shows how to make the sushi roll), 
-level one (make sushi roll), 
-level 2 (introduce new ingredient-tuna, to make tuna nigiri)
	-ingredient will appear on the empty counter
	- text will appear to explain how to make the tuna nigiri
	-signs around the kitchen will change (enable other signs and 	turn off previous signs)
-level 3 (make sushi roll),
level 4 (make both sushi roll and tuna nigiri)

how to make the tuna nigiri
-pick up the tuna
-place tuna and rice onto sushi mat
-wait _ seconds (particle will appear)
-tuna nigiri is done!
