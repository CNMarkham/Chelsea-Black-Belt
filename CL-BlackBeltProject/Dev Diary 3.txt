How has feedback from playtesting helped you with your game?


The feedback I got from my playtesting helped me know what to do next in my game and also things that could improve my game. 



What would be different if we skipped prototyping and went straight to the alpha or beta phase?

There would be less playtesting, meaning the game may have more bugs and might not be as fun.



During this phase, I learned how to make a digital image for my tutorial boards. I also added sound effects and background music.
