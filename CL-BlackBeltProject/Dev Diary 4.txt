Dev Diary 4

The feedback I received gave me an idea of what to improve on and what was good already. It also gave me ideas on what to add. For example, when I got feedback on adding indicators telling you if you've done an action correctly, I added confetti to show the player that they've completed it. I also got feedback on making the cutting easier, which I implemented the feedback to my game. I wasn't sure if the game timer was too short, but the feedback I got told me it was just right.
