Dev Diary 2

How did you plan, implement, and modify the mechanics from the planning stage?

Having everything planned helped me in my game because I knew exactly what needed to be done. Although it was a bit difficult to figure it out myself, it would've been even more difficult if I hadn't planned it before.



What challenges did you face? How did you overcome them?

I had a lot trouble trying to understand what to do next in my game. I was able to overcome them by asking for help and assistance.



What challenges will you foresee when converting your prototype to a full game?

I think that I will have trouble trying to figure what to do and how everything will work.
